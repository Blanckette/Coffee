I created this single-page website that mimics the layout and design of a cosy and inviting coffee shop, based on a mockup. My main goal was to enhance my understanding of web development by using only HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing website. This hands-on exercise allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical setting and further my skills in front-end web development.
